# CS61C-47C-Project
This repository includes my project for CompSci 47C : Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) at UC Berkeley in Spring 2022
I only did the last project:
NumC - My own simple version of numpy (a Python library for performing mathematical and logical operations on arrays and matrices, whose underlying code is written in C) and optimizing the operations for performance using assembly language (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj4/)
