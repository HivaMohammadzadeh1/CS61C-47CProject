### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?

  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): Hiva: 45 Joyee: 30
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): Hiva: 30 Joyee: 15

- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?

  - <b> Hiva: I liked everything about this project and it was very interesting to create the operations of matrix and numpy with code.
  - Joyee: This project was overall very interesting, but what I found most interesting was the SIMD optimization of mul in task 2.1, because of the pleasurable mental gymnastics required to figure out how to adapt three loops and their relationships to the particular structure of SIMD instructions.</b>

- What did you learn?

  - <b> Hiva: As a 47C student, I learned how to use my knowledge of parallelism and vectorization to speed up my operations. I learned what valgrind and CGBD are and how to use them to find memory leaks in my code.
  Joyee: I learned the nuances of how SIMD and pragma optimizes things and how to mold your code in order to take advantage of those optimizing powers, on a deeper level that the mere theoretical dictates on those two topics covered in lecture. Also, for task 1, I definitely gained familiarity with how to implement and manipulate structures and match subtly different data types, that I felt was slightly missing from my 61B experience.</b>

- Is there anything you would change?

  - <b>Hiva: I would start earlier and work more on it. Ask help earlier. I would rewrite mull function to be more optimized. That being said, I think the project could have more scaffolding for task 2.2. 
  - Joyee: I would definitely start earlier and take more advantage of Office Hours and Piazza! But barring that, I feel the project can be slightly longer, and seeing how desperate students are for extra credit going into finals szn, some of that extra length be translated into extra credit opportunities.</b>
